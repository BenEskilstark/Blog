      <h2>About</h2>
      I'm Ben Eskilstark. This website is where I'm aggregating my various coding projects as well as my blog.
      It's also a playground for me to mess around with web dev stuff.
      <p></p>
      I'm currently a senior systems programmer for Essex County NY. Where I started in 2023.
      <p></p>
      I'm a former Facebook engineer. I quit my job
      there on principle in January of 2020. Ask me why Facebook is bad! Or read
      about why I quit in <a href="../blog/DeadCodeSociety.html">my blog</a>

      <p></p>
      I've harbored a minor obsession with ants and bugs
      since I was stung by a wasp when I was 3 years old, so I've made a
      video game where you play as a queen ant trying to start your own colony from scratch.
      Check it out <a href="https://www.antocracy.io">here</a>.
