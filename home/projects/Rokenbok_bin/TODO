 - - - - - - TODO - - - - - -
 - Better performance
   - progressive seeding ?


 - - - - - - PROBABLY DON'T ACTUALLY NEED (UPON FURTHER REFLECTION) - - - - - -
 - use a lookup table for collisions with boks instead of comparing to each
 - Implement buying/placing as a queue instead of a single value
 - store selection on the state, not the entities
 - marker where your recording started


 - - - - - - DONE - - - - - -
 - detect collisions
 - only re-render boks when they change (pan/zoom)
 - seed function for bok initial positions
 - zoom can save canvas to bitmap and zoom the image instead of re-rendering everything
 - panning while zoomed in moves the view more than 1-to-1
 - write selector to convert canvas coord to world coord
 - detect what was clicked on when selecting
 - render which direction trucks/miners are facing
 - 'base' entity that miners move relative to
 - miners need UI/UX for setting direction away from base
 - miners should pick up boks they hit and turn around
 - miners should stop and wait at base then drop off/pick up at trucks/factories
 - visualize what trucks/miners are carrying
 - UI for tracking collected boks
 - UI for buying more trucks/miners/bases
 - placing selects the new entity
 - UI card explaining how selected miners work
 - Implement buying automating trucks
 - UI + data structure for recording truck movements and playing back
 - Implement timer in background
 - Correct implementation of hours place of milestones
 - separate entities for boks
 - Better hints for automation
   - button that returns you to your original theta
