    Columbus, Ohio

    <p></p>
    Yet another big driving day.
    <p></p>
    Inspired by my cabin fever yesterday, I had us listening to the Muppet
    Treasure Island songs while we drove. I had forgotten how funny that
    movie was, especially the group of muppet rats on board the pirate ship
    who think they're on a cruise and are singing about the margaritas at
    the midnight buffet. Plus the Trump-voter muppets who sing about
    forcing people to walk the plank and when confronted go "just kidding!"

    <p></p>
    We made it to Columbus without losing too much time and hung out
    in my parents' designated quarantine zone in the basement. First shower
    and warm bed in 4 days.

    First non-driving day in a bit. Exchanged Christmas present with my
    parents on their front patio which was really nice. Many errands were accomplished including
    the all-important Piada's lunch date (Piada's is Chipotle but for
    Italian food -- genius).

    <p></p>
    Catherine and I also went and climbed at the Audoban Metro Park climbing
    wall in 35 degree weather. It was miserable, and in my machismo I
    insisted on leading the big arch as the very first climb. It was just
    as hard as I remembered it being in high school and combined with my
    numb fingers turned into a hangdogging grind. It felt good to be moving
    again though.
    <p></p>
    At night, my high school friend Colin came over and we all watched
    Christmas Vacation out back by the fire pit. The movie is still so
    great!
