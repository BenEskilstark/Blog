Loveland, Colorado

Woke up in Utah and then drove I70 over the Rocky Mountains towards Denver.
Apparently I70 through Colorado is considered an engineering marvel of the
20th century as there are so many tunnels, canyons, bridges, and steep hills.

We crossed the Rockies and then
turned out of Denver up towards Loveland just as the sun was setting.
This time of evening the mountain majesties above the fruited plains really
do look purple.

Now in retrospect, the plan where we would cross the country and stay with
friends in a different city every night was doomed to lead to covid
exposure. Sure enough one of the people we stayed for dinner with
last night got back a positive test result 20 minutes after we arrived. We
were going to spend the night with them but decided it would be better
to drive a few miles to a campground in the hills which we ended up having
entirely to ourselves.
