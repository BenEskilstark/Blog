Las Vegas, Nevada

It seemed dry enough today to climb. Catherine, Jimmy, and I went to
Kraft to boulder while Michelle and Libby did some trad cragging.
Catherine biked the scenic loop in the morning while Jimmy and I
started bouldering. We climbed the Potato Chip boulder but it
seemed too wet there still to be in good form. Then we tried
Jones'n V4. I got to the top-out once or twice but wasn't confident
enough to commit to going over. It still felt good to dial the
lower down beta though as it is pretty overhung.

Then later in the afternoon we tried The Pearl V5 and neither
of us could do the first move, but I was able to get pretty
close to grabbing the next hold and improved at it over
several attempts. Despite not sending anything harder than V2 again
I feel like I'm still improving at bouldering. Specifically
the aspect on harder climbs where I have to split my focus
between each limb to maintain the proper tension at all times.
I'm more used to a set-it-and-forget-it approach to climbing
where each limb is as relaxed as possible when I'm not moving it.
Whereas on these harder boulders I have to maintain constant
tension everywhere to keep from falling.
