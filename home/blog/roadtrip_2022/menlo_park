Menlo Park, California

Move out day.

Catherine stayed up past 1 in the morning to finish grading her students
and editing her science paper so we didn't really get started packing up
until 10am. Fortunately we had already packed the entire bed of the truck
the day before and "only" had to pack all the kitchen stuff and clean everything.
Catherine mopped the floors (which I thought was overkill...) while I cleaned my
shoe marks off the ceiling from where I had smacked spiders.

We got on the road by 1pm with 141,710 miles on the truck. I did about 7.5 hours
of the 9 hour drive. During Catherine's portion of driving things got a bit
stressful. Catherine was hyperventilating while passing one of those giant
mobile homes while the road curved pretty steeply. And then later we
were chugging along at 60 miles per hour and I told Catherine to maybe
speed up a bit or else the semi behind us would want to pass us which would
also be stressful. But Catherine responded "no I won't speed up, I'm maintaining
my following distance with the truck in front of us" and pointed to the tiny
flickering tail lights about a quarter mile ahead of us.

Finally we rolled into the Sunfair Dry Lake Bed and slept on our cramped
platform in the truck bed together for the first time.
