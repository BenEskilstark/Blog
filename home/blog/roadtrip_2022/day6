Las Vegas, Nevada

Today we drove to the Gold Strike Mine Trail, a canyon trail that spits
you out at the Colorado River just around the corner from the Hoover Dam.
Near the river, hot springs well up from the ground and feel like hot tubs.
The fungus growing there was so large, colorful, and gooey I felt like I
wouldn't be surprised if it was casually and quietly sentient.

Catherine read about how if you scrambled upstream a bit there's an
old mining tunnel that is like a natural sauna. We went to check it out
while Catherine told me what else she read about it. Apparently the steam
inside gets so hot the further in you go that no one can bear to venture
in more than about 50 feet, and apparently if you do go back there you
can find the dead bodies of the original miners from 100 years ago
who were instantly killed when they struck the source of the steam.

I was skeptical of all this. For one, if it's so hot and steamy in there
why isn't there steam rising out of the cave? Plus they just left those
guys' bodies there and didn't even seal off the entrance or anything?
But anyway we made it over to the tunnel and I became a believer. The
cave was about 5 feet high and 6 feet tall with
hot-tub hot knee-high water going back into utter darkness. After stepping in
more than about 5 feet, the humidity in the air was stifling. We ventured
about 20 feet in by the light of Catherine's phone before fear of kicking a
pile of bones, and fear of suffocating, and fear of fainting from the
heat, and fear of toxic algae blooms turned us around.

Back at the regular hot springs on the trail, a large group of young women
each with a baby and a Trump or religion-themed shirt had congregated.
They were like some kind of cult. Catherine dubbed them the sister wives.
We didn't really interact with them except I was impressed/anxious that
they had made it down here babies in tow, and also they were playing obnoxiously
loud music.
