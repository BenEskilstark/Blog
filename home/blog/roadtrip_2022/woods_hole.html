    Woods Hole, Massachusetts
    <p></p>
    Snowy arrival in Woods Hole! We got set up in the suite apartment at
    Catherine's parents' house on the harbor, so we had our own little
    kitchen set up and everything. Due to our Covid scare earlier, we
    had Christmas in the garage (the huge and stately Garage-mahal)
    with the tree and everything in there. And we also zoomed all the
    extended families where we each had our own computer despite being
    in the same room.

    <p></p>
    After Christmas, we went to Martha's Vineyard -- a different experience
    in the winter. Courcelle has a cute little house there that's two
    stories but skinny. And we of course went to the Vineyard library
    and got many books.
    <p></p>

    Back on the cape, Wallace took the truck out with me to try to
    diagnose the grinding sound that has stumped many mechanics before.
    We didn't figure out anything conclusive but it was still a
    fun exercise.

    <p></p>
    During this whole time Catherine was working hard on her sewing projects.
    We went to Joann's on Christmas Eve and bought a hundred dollars of
    fabric and zippers and fleece that Catherine turned into many
    very professional-looking little bike bags and pencial holders
    and fanny packs and bill folds. Plus some admittedly not-so-professional
    looking fleece sweatpants. It was amusing coming up from dinner with
    the parents at like 9pm only for Catherine to go right back to the
    sewing machine!

    <p></p>
    We drove back up to Woods Hole yesterday from DC. We've decided to stay
    in the suite above Catherine's parents for the next 15 days so that if
    we ended up getting Covid during the prior festivities we wouldn't have
    to change any of our plans around like we did on the drive out east.
    (spoiler, we ended up threading the needle and NOT getting covid, but
    we didn't know that for sure until the 11th).
    <p></p>
    We did many fun Woods Hole winter activities while hanging out here in
    the village. First, we met our neighbor, also Ben, in the suite next door -- a Yale
    class of 2020 grad working on robotics stuff out here (I guess for deep sea
    submarines or something). He was holed up recovering from covid after catching
    it with the rest of his family over the holidays. So once he was allowed to
    go outside, Catherine and I went cross country skiing with him (all wearing masks)
    at the snowed-in golf course while he tromped next to us. The snow was so
    wet and sticky that it kept accumulating on my skiis, slowing me down even
    more than walking. He was interrogating me a bit on my reasoning behind quitting
    Facebook and I had to articulate it for the first time in a while which was a useful
    exercise. I was huffing and puffing so hard from lifting my iceblock skiis,
    plus I was being waterboarded by my breath-soaked mask so I probably sounded either
    really pensive or maybe even choked up about my time there. But really I could
    barely breath and needed to catch my breath mid sentence! Then on the walk back I
    slipped and fell hard on the sidewalk in my borrowed boots and wondered why
    they couldn't have made my skiis out of these boots, and maybe made the boots
    out of that grippy ski material.
    <p></p>
    Later, Catherine's old undergrad roommate (also just had covid) introduced us
    to a couple of her grad-school friends who just recently moved out
    to the Cape to postdoc at one of the scientific institutes here. They
    were funny because the first thing we did with them upon having met them
    for two minutes was run into the freezing ocean! (I did not participate,
    to my great regret, but stood guard on the beach). Apparently taking the plunge has been
    a ritual for them like a morning coffee or other pick-me-up.
    <p></p>
    Then a few days later, Catherine's mom took me and Catherine  + the grad-school friends
    clamming. We were in a salt-water harbor that had about an inch of ice that we
    post-holed through in our waders. Clamming is really interesting since there's
    a lot of legal stuff around it to prevent over harvesting. Catherine's mom has a
    permit she keeps pinned to her hat, and you're only allowed to do it on
    Sundays, and you have to have a regulated rake whose tongs will let through
    those clams that are still too young to harvest. It was interesting how almost
    all the clams we found were either just barely big enough or just barely too
    small to take. I guess everything bigger has just already gotten caught.
    We found some oysters too, which have separate rules about sizing, and I was
    proud of myself for finding one that was so big that it was just clearly legal
    and we didn't even need to check it with the measurer. There were so many
    people out there criss-crossing the frozen lake that at one point I noticed
    an ice sheet about 30 feet in diameter that was disconnected from the rest that
    I could push around with my hands. Also there was a cute (but huge) seagull of some
    sort picking through our discarded shells whose little feet kept slipping and sliding
    around on the ice.
    <p></p>
    That same afternoon, we went skating on the frozen fresh-water pond nearby. We got
    out there to find it bustling with hockey players (with the goals being stacks of beer
    cans) and parents teaching little kids to skate. Someone said he had probed the ice and that it
    was a full 2.5 centimeters thick! This did not inspire confidence and despite the
    hockey players tearing it up on one side of the pond, I was convinced I would be the
    tallest/heaviest person to fall and send myself right through the ice. I could
    hear it pinging beneath me as I tentatively skated around, and at one point when
    the 5 of us who went out there together were standing in a circle I watched a crack
    instantaneously appear between us.
