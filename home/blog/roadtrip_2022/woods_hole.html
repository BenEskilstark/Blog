    Woods Hole, Massachusetts
    <p></p>
    Snowy arrival in Woods Hole! We got set up in the suite apartment at
    Catherine's parents' house on the harbor, so we had our own little
    kitchen set up and everything. Due to our Covid scare earlier, we
    had Christmas in the garage (the huge and stately Garage-mahal)
    with the tree and everything in there. And we also zoomed all the
    extended families where we each had our own computer despite being
    in the same room.

    After Christmas, we went to Martha's Vineyard -- a different experience
    in the winter. Courcelle has a cute little house there that's two
    stories but skinny. And we of course went to the Vineyard library
    and got many books.

    Back on the cape, Wallace took the truck out with me to try to
    diagnose the grinding sound that has stumped many mechanics before.
    We didn't figure out anything conclusive but it was still a
    fun exercise.

    During this whole time Catherine was working hard on her sewing projects.
    We went to Joann's on Christmas Eve and bought a hundred dollars of
    fabric and zippers and fleece that Catherine turned into many
    very professional-looking little bike bags and pencial holders
    and fanny packs and bill folds. Plus some admittedly not-so-professional
    looking fleece sweatpants. It was amusing coming up from dinner with
    the parents at like 9pm only for Catherine to go right back to the
    sewing machine!
