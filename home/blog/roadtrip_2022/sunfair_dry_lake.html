    Sunfair Dry Lake Bed, California
    <p></p>

    It was very cold last night but we were encased in sleeping bags and
    pillows and blankets and so were pretty well bundled. It got below
    freezing though since my water bottle became a slushie.
    <p></p>

    We drove into Joshua Tree National Park and bought our annual
    national parks pass for 2022. Then we drove to the Barker Dam
    pullout and did some warmup climbs in the morning. There's a
    5.10c finger crack there that I've top-roped several times and
    always felt was exceedingly thin and difficult. This time I
    floated up it handily on my first try which felt good. The
    gear looks really fiddly though so it'll be another try before
    I go for the redpoint.
    <p></p>

    After lunch we hiked into the Wonderland of Rocks area with
    my sights set on a climb I spied there over a year ago on
    a feature called Foolproof Tower. We were hiking through
    last November to a different climb (Mental Physics) and I
    saw a striking crack that zigzagged up a tower and just had
    to know what it was. It turned out to be High Strung 5.9 but
    I didn't get the chance to climb it until today. And it was
    worth the wait!
    <p></p>

    The climb started on an imposing blank vertical face with a thin
    seam that widens to fingertips just past the point a 6 foot tall
    person could comfortably reach. I fiddled in a nut and my smallest
    BD #0.1 cam while on my tiptoes and then climbed back down to rest
    my calves. Then I went back up and went for it. The opening 20 feet
    was a leaning finger crack with good feet breaking up steep smearing.
    I placed 6 or 7 pieces of protection in this first section and was
    like "I gotta start putting more space between the gear or else I'll
    run out before I'm halfway up!" -- the climb being almost 100 feet tall.
    <p></p>

    The crack steadily widens from fingertips all the way through fists
    and BD #5 offwidth for the last 20 feet. This last section wasn't
    too hard, especially with my brand new ultra-light number 5 that
    replaced the old #5 I shamefully got stuck in Classic Crack of
    Calico two weeks ago outside Las Vegas. And then I was at the top
    of High Strung and I had flashed my first Joshua Tree 5.9 on lead!
    <p></p>

    Afterwards we had a nice 4pm dinner of gnocchi cooked on the side
    of the tailgate (because the bike rack inconveniently takes up
    the whole backside of the tailgate -- we're still working out the
    kinks in our truck-camping setup).

    We spent the night at the Sunfair Dry Lake Bed again and it was cold.
    When we woke up, the moisture in our breath had frozen to the rivets
    in the ceiling of the camper shell forming bunches of little icicles.
    However I discovered that the velcro I have with adhesive on the
    other side can be used to adhere my phone to the ceiling of the camper
    shell to allow me to watch Netflix with my phone suspended inches from
    my face.
    <p></p>

    Once the sun was out we went for a bike ride around the lake bed and up
    one of the 4x4 trails leading into the hills on the edge of the desert.
    We have no experience with mountain biking anything and it felt like
    re-inventing the wheel. We figured out that staying in a really low gear
    helps to keep you going through thick, slippery sand. Turns out those
    mountain bikers aren't pedaling away at 2 miles an hour for no reason.

    <p></p>
    Around lunch time we hung out for a bit and I marveled at the
    desert weather. I was hanging out in shorts and no shirt and
    Catherine was sitting with sweatpants and her puffy jacket and we
    were both perfectly comfortable!

    <p></p>
    Then we drove through the Mojave National Preserve to the Red Rock
    Canyon Campground where we met up with Michelle, Libby, and Jimmy.
