    Washington DC
    <p></p>

    For New Years Eve we joined my parents and the Rogers in an airbnb in Alexandria.
    We played a bunch of those TV + phone trivia games, including one where the
    premise is that everyone has been kidnapped by a Saw-style psycho murderer and
    have to answer random trivia questions to escape. The narration was actually
    hilarious and the minigame fights to the death among players who answered
    questions wrong were really fun and clever.

    <p></p>
    Catherine, Junior, and I did a bike ride up to Mt. Vernon in the morning rain
    on New Years Eve and Junior and I wiped out on a slippery bridge which was not
    fun. It also wasn't fun to get loudly kicked off the premises of Mt. Vernon by
    the angry security guard. 7/10 ride.

    <p></p>
    After New Years, Jane and Junior hosted us at their cute basement apartment
    in DC proper for a few more days. Junior took us on a bike tour of the
    DC stuff (see above for a picture of me flipping off the Trump International Hotel).
    Seeing the capitol building is always cool, but being almost exactly one year since
    January 6, 2021 it felt bittersweet -- especially considering that all the perpetrators
    are still at large.

    <p></p>
    Then the next day it snowed a solid 5 or 6 inches! We were going to leave the day
    after that but decided to stay an extra day to wait out the snow a bit. And good
    thing we did because we heard that there was a pileup on I-95 involving 6 tractor
    trailers and people on the highway behind them having to wait for like 15 hours
    to move on!
