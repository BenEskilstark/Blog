    Osborn, Missouri
    <p></p>

    The driving today started to put me over the edge. Three days of
    non-stop driving in a row is just too many. So when at 8pm I saw a sign
    for a chipotle I swerved us right on over there. I'm not sure where
    exactly this stop was, but masking seemed to start being a thing again,
    at least among the employees of the stores (the grocery store we stopped
    at outside Denver had probably 95% masks, but everywhere else since
    Vegas was more like 5%, including store employees). Not wearing a mask
    when the employees don't care either is one thing, but not wearing a mask
    when the employees are and don't have a choice whether to be there or
    not just seems downright evil. But I'm the outsider here so I do nothing.

    We were supposed to spend this night at our friends' house in Kansas City
    but because of our covid scare yesterday we diverted to a campground
    outside Osborn about an hour north. But the friends still decided to come
    up and join us in the cold up there that evening! We made a fire and hot
    chocolate (with bourbon) and caught up with each other.

    This was probably the coldest night yet.
