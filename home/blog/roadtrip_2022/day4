Las Vegas, Nevada

Rained today, so we stayed in. The airbnb's hot tub was not
pre-heated for us so we sat around all day watching the temperature
rise bit by bit. It was still only in the 70s by the time we went to bed.

I got Michelle and Libby totally sidetracked with a Pythagorean-themed
Project Euler problem.
