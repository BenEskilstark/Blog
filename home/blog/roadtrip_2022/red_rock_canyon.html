    Red Rock Canyon, Nevada

    <p></p>
    Woke up at 5:30am today to make the most of the climbing before
    it rains tomorrow. You're not supposed to climb on sandstone for
    at least a day or two after it rains or else you risk breaking
    the water-logged holds.

    <p></p>
    We climbed Beulah's Book 5.9 on the lower tier of the Solar Slab.
    And despite our early start we were the 3rd party to the base of the
    slabs. Michelle quested up the giant chimney and I followed her holding
    both her backpack and mine dangled between my legs (can't put it on
    my back when I need to put my back against the chimney). Catherine
    bravely followed as well. Then Michelle and I continued up on the upper
    tier on Going Nuts 5.6 for two pitches which meets up with Solar Slab
    proper on its 3rd pitch. We continued up 2 more pitches of Solar Slab
    but then decided to rappel as the party in front of us was having some
    issues (girlfriend: "Colin you're at the end of the rope!"
    Colin: "WHAT??"
    girlfriend: "You're at the end of your rope!!"
    Colin: "No you're not on belay!"
    ). Oh boy.

    <p></p>
    We rappelled back down with some Canadians who all friendly and hiked
    back to our car just as the sun set.

    Rained today, so we stayed in. The airbnb's hot tub was not
    pre-heated for us so we sat around all day watching the temperature
    rise bit by bit. It was still only in the 70s by the time we went to bed.

    <p></p>
    I got Michelle and Libby totally sidetracked with a Pythagorean-themed
    Project Euler problem.

    Slow morning, but we eventually went out to climb a bit at a Limestone
    Wall called Lone Mountain. The rock quality was perhaps the worst I
    have ever encountered. While lowering from my first pitch of the day
    I unknowingly stepped on a completely disconnected rock and knocked it
    free. I yelled "ROCK ROCK ROCK ROCK ROCK!" as the grapefruit-sized hunk
    hurtled towards Catherine. She stepped aside and it missed her by 3 feet!
    I've never knocked off a rock bigger than a ping pong ball before and
    this was scary. We all had helmets on, of course, but a grapefruit-sized
    chunk of limestone is gonna do some damage. We climbed really lightly after
    that and ended up calling it a day after just 2 climbs each.

    <p></p>
    Not going back there.

    Today we drove to the Gold Strike Mine Trail, a canyon trail that spits
    you out at the Colorado River just around the corner from the Hoover Dam.
    Near the river, hot springs well up from the ground and feel like hot tubs.
    The fungus growing there was so large, colorful, and gooey I felt like I
    wouldn't be surprised if it was casually and quietly sentient.

    <p></p>
    Catherine read about how if you scrambled upstream a bit there's an
    old mining tunnel that is like a natural sauna. We went to check it out
    while Catherine told me what else she read about it. Apparently the steam
    inside gets so hot the further in you go that no one can bear to venture
    in more than about 50 feet, and apparently if you do go back there you
    can find the dead bodies of the original miners from 100 years ago
    who were instantly killed when they struck the source of the steam.

    <p></p>
    I was skeptical of all this. For one, if it's so hot and steamy in there
    why isn't there steam rising out of the cave? Plus they just left those
    guys' bodies there and didn't even seal off the entrance or anything?
    But anyway we made it over to the tunnel and I became a believer. The
    cave was about 5 feet wide and 6 feet tall with
    hot-tub hot knee-high water going back into utter darkness. After stepping in
    more than about 5 feet, the humidity in the air was stifling. We ventured
    about 20 feet in by the light of Catherine's phone before fear of kicking a
    pile of bones, and fear of suffocating, and fear of fainting from the
    heat, and fear of toxic algae blooms turned us around.

    <p></p>
    Back at the regular hot springs on the trail, a large group of young women
    each with a baby and a Trump or religion-themed shirt had congregated.
    They were like some kind of cult. Catherine dubbed them the sister wives.
    We didn't really interact with them except I was impressed/anxious that
    they had made it down here babies in tow, and also they were playing obnoxiously
    loud music.

    It seemed dry enough today to climb. Catherine, Jimmy, and I went to
    Kraft to boulder while Michelle and Libby did some trad cragging.
    Catherine biked the scenic loop in the morning while Jimmy and I
    started bouldering. We climbed the Potato Chip boulder but it
    seemed too wet there still to be in good form. Then we tried
    Jones'n V4. I got to the top-out once or twice but wasn't confident
    enough to commit to going over. It still felt good to dial the
    lower down beta though as it is pretty overhung.

    <p></p>
    Then later in the afternoon we tried The Pearl V5 and neither
    of us could do the first move, but I was able to get pretty
    close to grabbing the next hold and improved at it over
    several attempts. Despite not sending anything harder than V2 again
    I feel like I'm still improving at bouldering. Specifically
    the aspect on harder climbs where I have to split my focus
    between each limb to maintain the proper tension at all times.
    I'm more used to a set-it-and-forget-it approach to climbing
    where each limb is as relaxed as possible when I'm not moving it.
    Whereas on these harder boulders I have to maintain constant
    tension everywhere to keep from falling.
