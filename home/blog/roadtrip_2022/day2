Joshua Tree, California

We spent the night at the Sunfair Dry Lake Bed again and it was cold.
When we woke up, the moisture in our breath had frozen to the rivets
in the ceiling of the camper shell forming bunches of little icicles.
However I discovered that the velcro I have with adhesive on the
other side can be used to adhere my phone to the ceiling of the camper
shell to allow me to watch Netflix with my phone suspended inches from
my face.

Once the sun was out we went for a bike ride around the lake bed and up
one of the 4x4 trails leading into the hills on the edge of the desert.
We have no experience with mountain biking anything and it felt like
re-inventing the wheel. We figured out that staying in a really low gear
helps to keep you going through thick, slippery sand. Turns out those
mountain bikers aren't pedaling away at 2 miles an hour for no reason.

Around lunch time we hung out for a bit and I marveled at the
desert weather. I was hanging out in shorts and no shirt and
Catherine was sitting with sweatpants and her puffy jacket and we
were both perfectly comfortable!

Then we drove through the Mojave National Preserve to the Red Rock
Canyon Campground where we met up with Michelle, Libby, and Jimmy.
