Las Vegas, Nevada

Slow morning, but we eventually went out to climb a bit at a Limestone
Wall called Lone Mountain. The rock quality was perhaps the worst I
have ever encountered. While lowering from my first pitch of the day
I unknowingly stepped on a completely disconnected rock and knocked it
free. I yelled "ROCK ROCK ROCK ROCK ROCK!" as the grapefruit-sized hunk
hurtled towards Catherine. She stepped aside and it missed her by 3 feet!
I've never knocked off a rock bigger than a ping pong ball before and
this was scary. We all had helmets on, of course, but a grapefruit-sized
chunk of limestone is gonna do some damage. We climbed really lightly after
that and ended up calling it a day after just 2 climbs each.

Not going back there.
