Las Vegas, Nevada

Woke up at 5:30am today to make the most of the climbing before
it rains tomorrow. You're not supposed to climb on sandstone for
at least a day or two after it rains or else you risk breaking
the water-logged holds.

We climbed Beulah's Book 5.9 on the lower tier of the Solar Slab.
And despite our early start we were the 3rd party to the base of the
slabs. Michelle quested up the giant chimney and I followed her holding
both her backpack and mine dangled between my legs (can't put it on
my back when I need to put my back against the chimney). Catherine
bravely followed as well. Then Michelle and I continued up on the upper
tier on Going Nuts 5.6 for two pitches which meets up with Solar Slab
proper on its 3rd pitch. We continued up 2 more pitches of Solar Slab
but then decided to rappel as the party in front of us was having some
issues (girlfriend: "Colin you're at the end of the rope!"
Colin: "WHAT??"
girlfriend: "You're at the end of your rope!!"
Colin: "No you're not on belay!"
). Oh boy.

We rappelled back down with some Canadians who all friendly and hiked
back to our car just as the sun set.
