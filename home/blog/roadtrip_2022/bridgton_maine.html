    Bridgton, Maine
    <p></p>
    Marcus, Liz, and Michelle came up the first weekend we were in Maine
    and we did cross-country skiing with them multiple times. I found it
    pretty frustrating at first to get the hang of turning, going up and
    down hills, and even just going straight on ground with a slight side-to-side
    tilt. XC skis only have one point of connection to my foot, so my control
    over them is less direct than I'd hoped.
    <p></p>
    We did some nice easy flat skiing over the frozen lake outside the cabin,
    but out chill morning was interrupted by the ominous creaks and lurching
    sounds of the ice beneath us. Despite being below freezing for at least a
    full week, and in the teens or lower for most of that, the water flow
    in a lake as it freezes can cause higher pressure zones that require even
    colder temperatures to fully freeze.
    <p></p>
    We also did some skiing on the other side of town at a nice groomed (and free!)
    course through the woods. On the drive over there, we passed several of those
    speed signs that display your speed back to you and flash red if you're over
    the limit. Except these signs also would display a different phrase whether
    you were over or under the limit. So when we went by one sign at 37 miles per
    hour it said "Bruh." and when we went by at 33 it said "Noice"! This ended up
    encouraging us to speed because we wanted to see what the phrase would be
    when we were going too fast
    <p></p>
    All in all a very cozy week heating the cabin with a wood stove, skiing for a
    bit, and reading by the fire.
