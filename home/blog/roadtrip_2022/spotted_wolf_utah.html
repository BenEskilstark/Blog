    Spotted Wolf View Area, Utah

    <p></p>
    Last morning in Las Vegas. Catherine, Michelle, and I went
    back to Kraft to boulder for a bit before going our separate
    ways. I messed around a bit on The Pearl V5 yesterday and
    tried it again today. Kraft was packed with people and we
    shared The Pearl with at least 10 other people trying it.
    The first move is so hard I was only able to hit it twice.
    The second time I made significant progress and was probably
    only one move away from getting through the crux of it, but I
    fell. I tried a dozen more times after that but could never
    even do the first move again. I feel pretty disappointed
    that I missed my chance to send, but it would also have been
    a big jump for me as I've only ever sent one V4 and no V5s.
    On our way out, Michelle and I did Plumber's Crack V5.9
    (it's tall!).

    Then Michelle drove back to her parents' new place in Arizona
    and Catherine and I hit the road towards Denver. We charged up
    into the mountains as the sun set and the full moon rose which
    was truly stunning (and iphones can't quite capture it, unfortunately).
    Around 11pm we stopped to spend the night at a rest stop called
    the Spotted Wolf View Area on I70 near the turn-off towards Moab.
    The truck was reading 9 degrees outside and it felt like it.
    Girtha even got to drive on her first snow! But we battened down
    the hatches in the camper shell and were fairly comfortable.
