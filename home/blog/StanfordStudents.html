			<h1>How Can You Tell the Difference Between a Stanford Undergraduate and a Stanford Grad Student?</h1>
			<h3>1/24/2020</h3>

      The grad students wear helmets when they bike.
      <p></p>
      It's a striking distinction that seemingly every Stanford grad student has noticed.
      I'm not sure if the undergrads are aware of this since I don't know any. But signs point
      to no since they don't appear aware of anything at all as they wheel around the
      campus at high speeds, stylish hair unencumbered by styrofoam or plastic. I've been biking
      around Stanford lately and the only thing more stressful than dodging
      the other students myself is witnessing the constant stream of near-misses around me.
      Here's a few snapshots all from a single day of biking back and forth:
      <p></p>
      An undergrad on a bike signals his left turn and then shoots the gap between
      four other bicycles going the other way, none of them changing speed or direction.
      Two undergrads are biking side-by-side ahead of me on a narrow path; another
      biker approaches head-on but has to skitter to a stop and catch himself on the
      curb as the two bikers don't form a single file or even pause their conversation.
      The undergrad who was abruptly stopped coming towards us is now standing in
      the grass and doesn't even look angry as we bike by. An undergrad on a skateboard
      scrolls instagram in one hand and holds a Starbucks coffee in the other. An undergrad
      on one of those electric-wheel-things zooms full-tilt through a roundabout also
      used by cars, passing inches from a runner in the crosswalk. Then at the next
      intersection I see a guy in a wheelchair coming from my right. Except it's
      motorized somehow and he rockets through the four-way stop making a left at easily 20 miles
      an hour, practically drifting this wheelchair right in front of me.
      This kid was wearing a motorcycle helmet though so he's probably getting a PhD.
      <p></p>
      Watching students bike around Stanford is like that Nintendo commercial where
      everyone gets teleported to the universe of Super Mario and gleefully jumps
      about on platforms and Goombas even though we all know that in a realistic world
      everyone would be dying over and over from their carelessness. It's like that scene
      near the end of <i>Final Destination</i> where the characters finally realize Death is
      out to get them and then look around and see a everything going  dangerously
      wrong -- the man dropping a propane tank that starts rolling down the hill,
      the electric pole shooting out a burst of sparks.
      <p></p>
      Changing gears a bit, last week I read Ed Catmull's <i>Creativity Inc.</i>
      When I took Advanced Computer Graphics in college I didn't realize that it could
      have just as accurately been called Stuff Ed Catmull Invented In The 70's.
      (For CS people, we owe to Ed: texture mapping, the Z-buffer, useful splines,
      smoothing of 3D models via recursively subdividing polygons, and more).
      This guy's lifestory is like a quintessential example of using skill to leverage lucky breaks.
      He got his PhD in computer science at University of Utah back when it was the fourth
      university to be connected to Internet-precursor ARPANET (after UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, and Stanford).
      Then he headed up George Lucas' computer research division at Lucasfilm during the making
      of <i>Return of the Jedi</i>. When Lucas ran out of money he decided to sell them off to the then-estranged-millionaire
      Steve Jobs. At first they worked on a specialized image processing computer that
      they called "The Pixar", but then switched to making animated movies:
      <i>Toy Story</i>, <i>A Bug's Life</i> (which is of special interest to this blogger),
      <i>Finding Nemo</i>, <i>Up</i>, <i>The Incredibles</i> and more. In the book
      Ed Catmull tries to lay out how he did it.
      <p></p>
      Catmull is the first to admit that he was not a super-genius who forged his life
      path out of sheer will -- luck played a big part. He relates a time when his dad got in an accident
      while the whole family was in the car and they stopped two inches short of falling
      off a cliff. Every Pixar movie was just two inches away from never existing. But then, Catmull asks,
      how many two-inches-away-from-not-existing moments did he and Pixar survive
      without even noticing? There's a sense of nausea that comes with trying to contemplate
      the enormous importance of every little moment and decision that brought you to
      where you are now. How can you stand the pressure to move forward knowing
      every move you make is so consequential?
      <p></p>
      Catmull says we have no choice but to acknowledge and embrace this randomness.
      He lays out several lessons to help navigate the unknown: If you're likely to make
      a wrong decision, be wrong as fast as possible so you can switch to the right one.
      But don't assume that because you did something, and then succeeded, that it
      must have been the right decision owing entirely to your skill -- randomness
      probably intervened on your behalf. Also cross-check your views against the perspectives
      of people you trust and listen to what they have to say. Finally don't rely
      entirely on luck, you have to seize every advantage you can find (something
      Steve Jobs was a master at).
      <p></p>
      As most of you know, I quit my cushy-but-unethical Facebook engineering gig
      in order to try to make my own video game. <i>Creativity Inc.</i> was a valuable
      persective on the technical-and-creative life that I am now pursuing.
      My takeaway is that maybe this creative life path is a bit like biking across
      Stanford's chaotic campus. And you know I'll be wearing a helmet.
